# Web Accessibility Essentials for Developers

Web accessibility ensures that websites and web applications are usable by people with disabilities. Creating accessible websites isn't just about compliance—it's about building better experiences for everyone.

## Why Accessibility Matters

Accessibility benefits:

- **People with disabilities**: Including those with visual, hearing, motor, or cognitive impairments
- **Older users**: Who may have changing abilities due to aging
- **Mobile users**: Who face similar challenges as disabled users (small screen, bright sunlight, one-handed use)
- **SEO**: Many accessibility practices improve search engine visibility
- **Legal compliance**: Many jurisdictions require accessible websites

## Understanding WCAG Guidelines

The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) provide a framework for making web content accessible, organized around four principles:

### 1. Perceivable

Information must be presentable to users in ways they can perceive.

- Provide text alternatives for non-text content
- Provide captions and alternatives for multimedia
- Create content that can be presented in different ways
- Make it easier for users to see and hear content

### 2. Operable

User interface components must be operable by all users.

- Make all functionality available from a keyboard
- Give users enough time to read and use content
- Do not use content that causes seizures
- Help users navigate and find content

### 3. Understandable

Information and operation of the user interface must be understandable.

- Make text readable and understandable
- Make content appear and operate in predictable ways
- Help users avoid and correct mistakes

### 4. Robust

Content must be robust enough to be interpreted by a wide variety of user agents, including assistive technologies.

- Maximize compatibility with current and future tools

## Practical Accessibility Techniques

### Semantic HTML

Using the right HTML elements for their intended purpose provides built-in accessibility benefits:

```html
<!-- Bad example -->
<div class="heading">Important Title</div>
<div class="button" onclick="doSomething()">Click Me</div>

<!-- Good example -->
<h2>Important Title</h2>
<button onclick="doSomething()">Click Me</button>
```

### Keyboard Navigation

Ensure all interactive elements can be accessed and operated using only a keyboard:

```html
<!-- Ensure focus styles are visible -->
<style>
  :focus {
    outline: 2px solid #4A90E2;
    outline-offset: 2px;
  }
</style>

<!-- Use proper tab order -->
<div>
  <a href="#content" tabindex="1">Skip to content</a>
  <!-- Primary navigation -->
  <nav tabindex="2">...</nav>
  <!-- Main content -->
  <main id="content" tabindex="3">...</main>
</div>
```

### ARIA Roles and Attributes

Use ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) to enhance accessibility when needed:

```html
<!-- Simple alert -->
<div role="alert">Your form has been submitted successfully.</div>

<!-- Custom checkbox -->
<div 
  role="checkbox" 
  aria-checked="false"
  tabindex="0"
  aria-labelledby="custom-checkbox-label">
</div>
<span id="custom-checkbox-label">Subscribe to newsletter</span>
```

However, use ARIA as a last resort—native HTML elements often provide better accessibility support.

### Color and Contrast

Ensure text has sufficient contrast against its background:

- WCAG AA requires a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1 for normal text
- WCAG AA requires a contrast ratio of at least 3:1 for large text (18pt+)
- Don't rely on color alone to convey information

```css
/* Good contrast */
.button {
  color: #ffffff;
  background-color: #3366cc; /* 4.5:1 contrast ratio */
}

/* Include indicators beyond color */
.error-message {
  color: #d40000;
  border-left: 4px solid #d40000;
  padding-left: 1em;
}
```

### Alternative Text for Images

Provide descriptive alt text for images that convey information:

```html
<!-- Informational image -->
<img src="chart-q2-sales.png" alt="Bar chart showing Q2 sales increased 27% year-over-year">

<!-- Decorative image -->
<img src="decorative-line.png" alt="">

<!-- Complex image with extended description -->
<figure>
  <img src="complex-diagram.png" alt="Network architecture diagram" aria-describedby="diagram-desc">
  <figcaption id="diagram-desc">
    Diagram shows three-tier architecture with web servers connecting to application servers 
    and database servers through a load balancer.
  </figcaption>
</figure>
```

### Forms

Create accessible forms with proper labels, error handling, and instructions:

```html
<form>
  <div class="form-group">
    <label for="name">Full Name</label>
    <input 
      type="text" 
      id="name" 
      name="name" 
      aria-required="true" 
      aria-describedby="name-hint"
    >
    <span id="name-hint" class="hint">Enter your legal first and last name</span>
  </div>
  
  <!-- Error messaging -->
  <div class="form-group has-error">
    <label for="email">Email Address</label>
    <input 
      type="email" 
      id="email" 
      name="email"
      aria-invalid="true" 
      aria-describedby="email-error"
    >
    <div id="email-error" class="error-message" role="alert">
      Please enter a valid email address
    </div>
  </div>
  
  <button type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>
```

### Focus Management

Properly manage keyboard focus, especially for:

- Modal dialogs
- Form validation errors
- Dynamic content updates
- Single-page application navigation

```javascript
// Focus trap example for modal dialog
function openModal() {
  const modal = document.getElementById('modal');
  const focusableElements = modal.querySelectorAll('button, [href], input, select, textarea, [tabindex]:not([tabindex="-1"])');
  const firstElement = focusableElements[0];
  
  modal.classList.add('open');
  firstElement.focus();
  document.addEventListener('keydown', trapFocus);
}

function trapFocus(e) {
  // Trap focus within modal
  if (e.key === 'Tab') {
    // Implementation details...
  }
}
```

### Responsive Design

Ensure your site works at different zoom levels and viewport sizes:

```css
/* Responsive text */
html {
  font-size: 100%; /* Respects user's browser settings */
}

body {
  font-size: 1rem; /* Relative to html font-size */
  line-height: 1.5;
}

/* Responsive layouts */
.container {
  max-width: 1200px;
  padding: 0 1rem;
  margin: 0 auto;
}

@media (max-width: 768px) {
  .multi-column {
    flex-direction: column;
  }
}
```

## Testing for Accessibility

### Automated Testing

Use tools to catch common issues:

- Lighthouse in Chrome DevTools
- axe DevTools
- WAVE Evaluation Tool
- jsx-a11y ESLint plugin for React projects

### Manual Testing

Always supplement automated tests with manual checks:

- Keyboard navigation testing
- Screen reader testing (NVDA, JAWS, VoiceOver)
- High contrast mode
- Browser zoom (up to 200%)

### Testing Checklist

For each component or page, verify:

- [ ] Proper heading structure (h1-h6)
- [ ] All images have alt text
- [ ] Color contrast meets WCAG AA standards
- [ ] Forms have proper labels and error handling
- [ ] Interactive elements have focus states
- [ ] Page works without a mouse
- [ ] Page is understandable with a screen reader
- [ ] No automatic content changes that can't be paused

## Conclusion

Web accessibility is a continuous practice, not a one-time task. Building with accessibility in mind from the start is much easier than retrofitting it later. Remember that accessible design benefits all users, not just those with disabilities.

By following these essential practices, you'll create websites that are more usable, more legally compliant, and reach a wider audience.
