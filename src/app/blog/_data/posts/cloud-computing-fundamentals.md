# Cloud Computing Fundamentals Explained

Cloud computing has transformed how businesses build, deploy, and manage their IT infrastructure. Instead of investing in expensive on-premises hardware and software, organizations can now leverage on-demand computing resources delivered via the internet. This guide explores the fundamental concepts of cloud computing and how it can benefit your organization.

## What is Cloud Computing?

At its core, cloud computing is the delivery of computing services—including servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and intelligence—over the internet ("the cloud") to offer faster innovation, flexible resources, and economies of scale.

Key characteristics of cloud computing include:

- **On-demand self-service**: Provision computing capabilities as needed without human interaction from the service provider
- **Broad network access**: Capabilities available over the network and accessed through standard mechanisms
- **Resource pooling**: Computing resources pooled to serve multiple consumers
- **Rapid elasticity**: Capabilities can be quickly scaled up or down based on demand
- **Measured service**: Resource usage is monitored, controlled, and reported for transparency

## Cloud Service Models

Cloud services are typically offered in three main models, often described as a layered architecture:

### Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)

IaaS provides virtualized computing resources over the internet. It gives users access to computing infrastructure such as virtual machines, storage, and networks.

**Key characteristics**:
- Most flexible cloud model
- Complete control over infrastructure
- Users responsible for managing operating systems, applications, and data
- Pay-as-you-go pricing model
